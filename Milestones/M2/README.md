# Lumen M2 - Goal

in the Entire Lumen's Journey, i've been using ChatGPT to code because i don't know code, So my goal is to, When i learn atleast begginner- and intermediate-level of C and C++, i rewrite most of Lumen's code.

I'm currently using Sololearn to learn C and C++. i Hope i can Learn so i can Make authentic code on PalisadeOS.

## What will change

After i learn code, AI code will be abandoned to make my code. the changes will be:

- Major Codebase Rewrite
- Code modifications
- Empty folders removal
- Makefiles' Changes
- Code expansion
- More strict system integrations
- Functional system files

i'll avoid stubbing/scaffolding files much so i don't forget stubbed/placeholder files.

Also, avoiding AI code will help me, because there will be no stubbed/faked/placeholder files disguised as "fully-functional".

Thank you for your support.

Rewrite starting now, as for january 28 of 2026. i'm still testing my code knowledge, with this test, came the C switch files to test how much of C's switch concept i know!
