# PalisadeOS Internal Builds Project (PIBP)
PalisadeOS Milestone M1 (or 1.0.6) delivers a system-grade GUI stack: power-aware animations, vibrant shaders, shadowed layers, safety popups, thermal and battery protection, gesture handling, debug overlays, and compositor extensions, bringing responsive, efficient visuals across desktop and mobile hardware with zero app dependence OS. Also, Big structure changes in the directory tree like shortening.

Later builds, like PalisadeOS M2, Aim to add important missing things to avoid incompatibility or "Toy GUI" failures.
